# Student Management System - MVC, AJAX, ADO.NET

## Overview
The **Student Management System** is a web application built using ASP.NET MVC, AJAX, and ADO.NET for managing student records. This system allows for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data, with features like updating student details in real-time using AJAX without page reloads.

This project demonstrates how to build a web application using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, **AJAX** for asynchronous data submission, and **ADO.NET** for database interaction.

## Features
- **View Student Data**: Display a list of all students.
- **Edit Student Details**: Modify student information, including name, age, branch, and phone number.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Use AJAX for updating student records without refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET MVC**: Used for building the web application following the MVC design pattern.
- **AJAX**: For asynchronous HTTP requests to the server, ensuring smooth user interaction.
- **ADO.NET**: Used for interacting with the SQL Server database and executing CRUD operations.
- **JavaScript/jQuery**: Handles client-side interactions and AJAX requests.
- **SQL Server**: Database for storing student records.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed before running this project:
- **.NET Core SDK**: For running ASP.NET Core applications.
- **SQL Server**: To store the student data.
- **Visual Studio** (Optional): IDE for developing and running the project.
